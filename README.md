# Simple-Banking-System
This is a simple banking system that uses Python and SQL. SQL is used to store the user information of generated credit cards and pins in a database that the user will be able to pull from to do simple banking options. Python was used to access sqlite3 and to implement the usage of Luhn's algorithm for credit card verification.
